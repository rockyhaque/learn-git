# Adding a Remote in Git

In Git, another repository is called a **"remote"**. The standard convention is to name the remote **"origin"** when treating it as the **"authoritative source of truth"**â€”the repository that contains the most up-to-date and accepted version of the code.

---

## Command Syntax

To add a remote, use the following command:

```bash
git remote add <name> <uri>
```

- `<name>`: The name you want to assign to the remote (e.g., `origin`).
- `<uri>`: The location of the remote repository (can be a URL or a relative/absolute path).

## Assignment

### Goal

Inside the new `webflyx-local` repository, add the original `webflyx` repository as a remote.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the `webflyx-local` directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/webflyx-local
   ```

2. Add `webflyx` as a remote with the name `origin`. Use the relative path to the `webflyx` directory:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin ../webflyx
   ```

3. Verify the remote has been added:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

You should see output showing `../webflyx` as the URI for the `origin` remote.
