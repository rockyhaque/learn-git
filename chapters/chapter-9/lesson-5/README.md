# Log Remote

The `git log` command is not just useful for your local repository. You can also use it to view the commits from a remote repository!

### Command Syntax

To log commits from a remote repository, use the following syntax:

```bash
git log <remote>/<branch>
```

For example, to see the commits from the `primeagen` branch on the `origin` remote:

```bash
git log origin/primeagen
```
