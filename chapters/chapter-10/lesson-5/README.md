# Pull Requests

On GitHub, a pull request is a way to propose changes, typically to the rest of your team or to the maintainer of a project you're contributing to.

Pull requests allow team members to see what changes are being proposed and to discuss them before they are merged into the main codebase.

## Assignment

1. Switch to a new branch called `add_classics` off of `main`.
2. Add another line to the `classics.csv` file:

   ```
   Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock, 1960
   ```

3. Stage and commit the change, and prefix the commit message with **L:**.
4. Push the new branch to GitHub (push it to the remote `add_classics` branch).
5. Navigate to the GitHub repo in your browser.
6. Click on the **"Pull requests"** tab near the top.
7. Click **"New pull request"**.
8. Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `add_classics`, as we plan to merge `add_classics` into `main` later.
9. Create the pull request, but don't merge it yet!
