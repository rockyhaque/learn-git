# GitHub Repository

GitHub is the most popular website for hosting Git repositories (projects) online. It serves multiple purposes:

- **Backup:** Keeps all your code safe on the cloud in case of computer failure.
- **Collaboration:** Provides a central place to share and work on code with others.
- **Portfolio:** Acts as a public showcase for your coding projects.

## Git vs. GitHub

It's important to understand the difference between Git and GitHub:

- **Git** is an open-source command-line tool for managing code files and version control.
- **GitHub** (along with competitors like GitLab and Bitbucket) is a commercial web platform that provides hosting and additional tools for managing Git repositories.
