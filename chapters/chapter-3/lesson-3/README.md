# Exploring Git Object Files

Git stores all its data as objects in the `.git/objects` directory. These objects are compressed and stored in a binary format, making them unreadable as plain text. In this lesson, you'll learn how to inspect the contents of a Git object file to understand what it contains.

## What is a Git Object File?

A Git object file is a compressed file that stores data such as commits, trees, and blobs. These files are located in the `.git/objects` directory and are named using the SHA-1 hash of their contents. For example, a commit object might be stored in a file like `.git/objects/5b/a786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f`.

## Inspecting a Git Object File

To inspect the contents of a Git object file, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Object File:**  
   Use `git log` to find the commit hash and locate the corresponding object file in the `.git/objects` directory. For example:

   ```bash
   ls -al .git/objects/5b/a786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
   ```

2. **View the Raw Contents:**  
   Attempt to view the contents of the file using the `cat` command:

   ```bash
   cat .git/objects/5b/a786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
   ```

   You'll notice that the output is unreadable because the file is compressed.

3. **View the Contents in Hexadecimal Format:**  
   Use the `xxd` command to view the contents of the file in hexadecimal format:

   ```bash
   xxd .git/objects/5b/a786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
   ```

   This will display the file's contents in a readable hexadecimal format.

4. **Save the Output to a File:**  
   Redirect the output of `xxd` to a temporary file for further inspection:
   ```bash
   xxd .git/objects/5b/a786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f > /tmp/commit_object_hex.txt
   ```

## Understanding the `/tmp/commit_object_hex.txt` File

The `/tmp/commit_object_hex.txt` file contains the raw hexadecimal representation of the Git object. Here's what you need to know about it:

- **Hexadecimal Representation:**  
   The left column shows the **offset** (memory address) of the data in hexadecimal format. The middle columns show the **raw bytes** of the file in hexadecimal, and the right column shows the **ASCII representation** of those bytes (if printable).

- **Compressed Data:**  
   Git object files are compressed using **zlib compression**, so the raw bytes you see are not human-readable. The hexadecimal output represents the compressed data.

- **Structure of a Git Object:**  
   A Git object file typically contains:
  - **Header:** The type of object (e.g., `commit`, `tree`, `blob`) and its size.
  - **Content:** The actual data stored in the object (e.g., commit metadata, file contents).

## Where to View `/tmp/commit_object_hex.txt`

The `/tmp/commit_object_hex.txt` file is saved in the `/tmp` directory, which is a temporary directory on your system. You can view its contents using the following methods:

1. **Using `cat` Command:**  
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/commit_object_hex.txt
   ```

2. **Using a Text Editor:**  
   Open the file in a text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or any GUI-based editor:

   ```bash
   nano /tmp/commit_object_hex.txt
   ```

3. **Using a File Manager:**  
   Navigate to the `/tmp` directory using your system's file manager and open the file directly.

## Why Inspect Git Object Files?

- **Understand Git Internals:** Inspecting object files helps you understand how Git stores and manages data.
- **Debugging:** If something goes wrong, examining object files can help you diagnose issues.
- **Learning:** Exploring Git's internal data structures is a great way to deepen your knowledge of how Git works.
