# When to Use Rebase vs. Merge in Git

## Introduction

In Git, both **rebase** and **merge** are used to integrate changes from one branch into another. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct advantages and disadvantages. This README explains when to use each tool and provides guidelines for maintaining a clean and efficient Git workflow.

## Key Differences Between Rebase and Merge

### Merge

- **Purpose**: Combines changes from one branch into another by creating a **merge commit**.
- **Advantages**:
  - Preserves the **true history** of the project, including when and where branches were merged.
  - Safer for shared branches (e.g., `main` or `develop`) because it doesn’t rewrite history.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can create a cluttered history with many merge commits, making it harder to read and understand.

### Rebase

- **Purpose**: Integrates changes by **replaying** commits from one branch on top of another, creating a **linear history**.
- **Advantages**:
  - Produces a clean, linear history that is easier to read and understand.
  - Avoids unnecessary merge commits, making the history more streamlined.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Rewrites commit history, which can cause issues if used improperly (e.g., on public branches).

## When to Use Merge

- **Preserve History**: Use merge when you want to maintain the complete history of branch divergences and merges.
- **Team Collaboration**: Merge is safer for shared branches (e.g., `main` or `develop`) because it doesn’t rewrite history.
- **Simplicity**: Merge is straightforward and less likely to cause conflicts during integration.

## When to Use Rebase

- **Clean History**: Use rebase to maintain a linear and clean commit history, especially for feature branches.
- **Local Branches**: Rebase is ideal for personal or local branches that haven’t been shared with others.
- **Avoid Merge Commits**: Use rebase if you want to avoid cluttering the history with merge commits.

## Warning: Never Rebase Public Branches

- **Public Branches**: You should **never rebase a public branch** (e.g., `main`) onto anything else. Other developers may have it checked out, and rewriting its history will cause significant problems for them.
- **Your Own Branches**: With your own branches, you can rebase onto other branches (including public branches like `main`) as much as you want. This is a safe and effective way to keep your branch up-to-date.

## Best Practices

1. **Rebase Local Branches**: Rebase your feature branches onto the latest `main` or `develop` branch before merging them.
2. **Merge Shared Branches**: Always use merge for integrating changes into shared branches like `main` or `develop`.
3. **Avoid Rebasing Published History**: Never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared repository, as it rewrites history and can cause issues for others.
4. **Resolve Conflicts Carefully**: Both merge and rebase can result in conflicts. Resolve them carefully and test your changes afterward.

## Conclusion

- **Merge** is about preserving history and is safer for shared branches.
- **Rebase** is about creating a clean, linear history and is ideal for local branches.
- Use the right tool for the job, and always communicate with your team to avoid confusion.
