# Chapter 5: Branching

In this chapter, you'll learn how to effectively use **branches** in Git to manage different versions of your project. Branches allow you to work on features, experiments, or bug fixes in isolation, making it easier to collaborate and maintain a clean project history. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand how to create, switch, and merge branches, as well as explore Git's internal storage of branch information.
